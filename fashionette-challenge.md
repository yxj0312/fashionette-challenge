## Tasks

1. JSON API for TV shows by their name: https:://json-api/?q=deadwood.

2. Any other request to the API is invalid and should return the appropriate response.

3. non-case sensitive and non-typo tolerant

4. Optimization of the number of HTTP requests

5. Best practices

6. Test

## Thinkings

1. More third party service, not only tvmaze api

2. More features of tvmaze api, like search schedule, country

3. More validations of request query('name'), like regex check for some special symbols i.e '?', '!'

4. Authentication middleware?

5. Design pattern: Decorator, Adapter,

6. Limit request numbers
